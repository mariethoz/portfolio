# 🤝 Soft Skills

## Planning & Organisation

- I took part in planning and organising the workflow of the project, with a focus on the robotic component.
This included:
    - Identifiyng the main part of the project and potential difficulty
    - Identifying the main technical steps required to use the robot safely and efficiently
    - Defining what needed to be learned or tested first before moving to creative experimentation with the robot
    - Coordinating with the robot expert to schedule onboarding, safety, and experimentation sessions

## Communication & Collaboration

- One of my key roles was understanding the robot system well enough to explain it to others.
    This involved:
    - Translating technical constraints into accessible language
    - Explaining what is possible (and what is not) with the robot
    - Helping other teams adapt their ideas to robotic realities

## Knowledge Sharing

- I helpt prepare and present the robot workflow to the other teams. This helped reduce misunderstandings between design, generation, and fabrication. Ensuring everyone had:
    - A shared mental model of how the robot will works
    - Clear expectations about timing, precision, and constraints
