# Questions list

This part of the portfolio is linked to the work for the 304 Major Track module. It is asked to give a 3 questions I like to be asked after each week of work on the related project ([Duckify](https://github.com/Toys-R-Us-Rex/Duckify)).

## Week 1

- What were the main constraints of the robot, and how did they influence the design decisions of the project?
- Why was planning and safety such an important focus during the first week of the project?
- How did you communicate technical limitations to non-robotics team members?

## Week 2

- What does TCP mean and how it is calibred, how do you validate that it is successful?
- Why do rotations (rx, ry, rz) pose more difficulty than positions (x, y, z) in robotic control?
- How did the team reorganisation impact your work, and how did you adapt?
