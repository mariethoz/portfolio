## 👋 Introduction

I started my journey in 2013 by an apprentiship **automation technician** then move in **Industrial System engineer**. From where I drift into the world of digitalisation passing by **IA** in robot control to **data eingenerring**.

I enjoy building systems where **hardware, software, and data meet**, especially when they involve real-world interaction.
